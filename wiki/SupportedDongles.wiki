Currently there are three USB dongles supported by the project. The dongles all operate using a CC111x SOC(System on Chip).

The dongles are:
<ul>
<li>IM-Me dongle</li>
<li>CC1111EMK dongle</li>
<li>Chronos dongle</li>
</ul>

This product is originally a portable instant message toy for girls to communicate with each other. But the IM-Me dongle can do more, it contains a CC1110 chip for wireless communication. 

Information about hacking the IM-Me dongle can be found [http://hackaday.com/2010/10/23/im-me-usb-dongle-hacking/ here].

== CC1111EMK dongle ==

The CC1111EMK (Evaluation Module Kit) dongle is an evaluation dongle from Texas Instruments for their CC1111 chip. The dongle includes a debug header and a header containing test pins. 

This dongle is probably the most easy to use because it is ready to use.

The Chronos dongle is included in the Chronos watch kit. The Chronos watch kit is a development kit produced by Texas Instruments to develop timing applications. The kit includes a dongle that contains a CC1111 chip. 

By programming this dongle with the alternative firmware provided here it can be used in custom applications. In order to program the Chronos dongle it a program header has to be added.
