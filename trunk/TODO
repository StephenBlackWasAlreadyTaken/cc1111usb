fill out options for CC1111 stuff like DMA, etc....  right now it's skeleton and fits what i need, but perhaps not what others want.

make python client handle multiple dongles at once

detection firmware
    * reduce all dependence upon the data
        * fixed length (0x10? 0x20?)
        * no syncword
        * no address
        * no manchester encoding / fec
        * no crc
    * bit-analysis to determine possible sync-words

cc1111nicserver.py
    * listen on two TCP ports
        * one to xmit/recv data
        * one to reconfigure the radio/chip settings

IMME Sniffer
    * UI
        * power off/on/reset
        * adjust frequency/channel/spacing
        * adjust data rate and bw
        * adjust GFSK/MSK/OOK
        * adjust channel

cc1111nic.py/appNIC
    * add frequency hopping settings and sync/methods
        * primary channel - method
        * "waiting" method

cc1111client.py
    * simplify queuing?
    * make recv() take an app and cmd as well, simplifying getting the right response even if others occur in the interrim.

all USB firmwares:
    * add reset capability to EP0's commands
    * add stall recovery to client and EP0 commands (explore this one...)
    * add poke() functionality to EP0's commands
